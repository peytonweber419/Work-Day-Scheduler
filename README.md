# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

Using JavaScript and API's like day.js and jQuery, I have made a functional work day scheduler. The times range from 9AM to 5PM, the current date is displayed at the top of the page, and past, present, and future times are color coded by tracking the current time of day.
